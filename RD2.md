We were supposed to learn and accomplish creating a code, using mainly functions and while loops, within those functions. We 
also focused on error checking so the user could mess up without the code shutting down. The steps followed were thoroughly 
reading the ReadMe file, writing our algorithm, testing the inputs with our test cases, testing extreme and various cases to 
make sure error checking worked, and trial and error. The key concepts explored in this 
lab were functions, while loops, and error checking. The results matched what I expected to get and match the results needed 
by our friend who needs their rooms redone. Some of the challenges we encountered was choosing what to make a function and how
to set up the code so that it would operate the correct amount of times and calculate the correct price. We followed the first 
three rules of programming by planning out our code, creating a human-readable essay for our algorithm and testing our code
multiple times to make sure it was just right. We overcame our challenges by discussing with our classmates and sharing our 
ideas with one another to find the perfect plan. I think I learned what I was supposed to from this lab because our code matches
our results, and now I am more familiar with functions than I was before. Working with Jose was great, we split up the work well
and communicated effectively outside of lab time.
