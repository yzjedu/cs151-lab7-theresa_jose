Objective:
In this project, the main goal was to learn how to design and implement functions in Python to solve a real-world problem. Specifically, we were tasked with calculating the cost of flooring for five rooms based on user inputs for room dimensions and floor type. Additionally, we focused on practicing good Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles, which involved creating a user-friendly experience that accounted for potential user input errors. Part of the objective was to break down the problem into functional components, integrating each function into a cohesive algorithm to achieve the desired output.

Procedure:
The first step was to create a well-structured algorithm that defined each required function and clearly outlined how they would interact with one another. I started by designing functions for getting room length, width, and flooring type, as well as calculating the area and room cost based on these inputs. Following this algorithm carefully helped streamline the coding process. I used while loops and if-elif statements to handle user input validation, ensuring that only valid values were accepted. This involved checking if the length and width were positive numbers and that the flooring type matched one of the acceptable options (hardwood, carpet, or tile). Using .lower() and .strip() helped ensure the code recognized the flooring type correctly, regardless of the capitalization or extra spaces in the user input.

Results:
Surprisingly, the final code turned out to be shorter and more straightforward than I had anticipated, despite the initial complexity of the problem. Although the math involved was basic, repeatedly prompting the user for specific details for each of the five rooms felt intricate. To test the program, I tried various inputs like “hardWood” to see if it accurately recognized the flooring type regardless of capitalization. I also tested with large room dimensions, and the code handled these cases smoothly, providing accurate cost calculations.

Reflection:
One challenge I encountered was defining and implementing functions correctly within the code. I often had to refer to lecture notes for guidance on the structure and usage of functions. Additionally, ensuring each function worked together as intended and was appropriately called within main() took some effort. I found that functions simplify and organize code, making it cleaner and easier to follow, which adheres to the first three rules of programming: simplicity, clarity, and effectiveness. Previous project experiences and lecture notes were instrumental in helping me overcome these obstacles. My main takeaway from this project is that functions, though challenging at first, significantly enhance the readability and functionality of code. They provide structure and open up possibilities for future projects in Python.

Working with my partner made the process much smoother, as she provided a clear algorithm and flowchart that guided the coding stage effectively. Her contributions in planning made the implementation much less stressful and more efficient than previous labs. Overall, I feel that I achieved the lab’s learning goals and gained a deeper understanding of functions and structured programming.
