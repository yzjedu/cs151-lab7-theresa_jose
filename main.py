# Programmers: Theresa and Jose
# Course:  CS151, Dr. Zelalem Jembre Yalew
# Due Date: 9/16/2024
# Lab Assignment: 7
# Problem Statement: Our friend just bought a new house, but all of the rooms have carpet or laminate that is horribly
# dirty and gross.
#You need to design, write, and test a program that calculates the cost of buying flooring for your friendâ€™s house.
# Your friend may need to test the cost with different designs, so your program should ask your friend if they want to check the cost of another design.
# Data In: Length and width of flooring in each room, and type of flooring being installed
# Data Out:  Total balance of all the rooms combined
# Credits: In Class
